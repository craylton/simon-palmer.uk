## There is no Housing Crisis
21st December 2025

We all know there's a housing crisis. We're repeatedly told in news articles about the housing crisis. Online influencers and commentators talk about the housing crisis all the time. Although this article is focused on the UK, this is a common theme across the whole developed world - house prices are so high that nobody can afford to buy them.

And yet, when you think about it, something doesn't quite make sense. If nobody can afford to buy houses, why are estate agents still in business? Why are 'Sold' signs appearing every day?

Here's the thing - there is no crisis. People are buying houses all the time! The market isn't broken at all, it's functioning exactly as intended. House prices are high specifically _because_ there is a queue of people with money ready to buy.

To be clear, I'm not claiming that there isn't a problem. I know a lot of people who want to buy (or move) but they're really struggling. Something is clearly wrong. But prices and availablity aren't the problem. The problem is people's _expectations_.

Think about it - if house prices halved overnight for no apparent reason, lots of people would get very excited and try and buy a house right away. There's be such a surge, that sellers would have no choice but to increase their prices, since there simply aren't enough houses on the market for all the buyers. So immediately after halving in value, house prices would bounce back up again. This is an efficient market in action - prices are a function of supply and demand.

At the time of writing, we are in a buyer's market where there are more sellers than buyers, and therefore prices are stagnating a bit. But overall there are around [100,000 residential property transactions per month in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-property-transactions-completed-in-the-uk-with-value-40000-or-above/uk-monthly-property-transactions-commentary--2). And it's been like that for years.

And you might try and tell me that the majority of buyers are people who already own a property, and are looking to move. But actually, [first-time buyers are the _largest_ buyer group](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/discover/property-news/house-price-index/), accounting for about 35-40% of all buyers. And this FTB activity is only projected to increase.

I find it slightly ironic when two people are both looking to buy a house, and they're both complaining to each other about how expensive houses are. They don't even seem to realise that they're competing against one another, and that that competition is exactly what causes houses to be expensive!

Now here's a claim that's sure to get people riled up: when people say they "can't buy a house", what they actually mean is they "can't buy a detached three-bedroom house in a trendy postcode". People I speak to usually find this point impossible to accept. Imagine you do your budgeting to find out exactly what you can afford, and you find that you have £200,000 to spend on a house. A lot of people just straight up give up at this point, saying "there are no houses in my price range". Which is a lie! Go on Rightmove and actually look! There are places in the outskirts, flats, run down properties that need work, plenty of cheap housing. The problem is: nobody _wants_ these properties - everyone thinks they deserve more.

To be fair, if you work hard and save money for multiple years, it's insulting to be rewarded with a beaten up flat in the middle of nowhere. But the reality is, affordable property _is_ out there; it's just crap and nobody wants to live there. The crisis is that we feel entitled to our parents' lifestyle without moving to where our parents lived.

Previous generations bought smaller homes with one bathroom and no central heating. Today, we view a "fixer-upper" as a crisis. [todo: source][todo: find info about the "Space Race"—the post-pandemic surge in value for detached homes vs. flats.]

Ultimately the housing market is just like any other market - ruthless and efficient. Prices are set based on what people are willing to pay. There are only two reasons why house prices would go down:
- If supply increases - or in other words, we build more houses. But many, many houses would need to be built to make a difference (keep in mind that there are blah houses in the UK sitting empty already).[todo: find actual number]
- If demand falls. If unemployment shot up all of a sudden for example, suddenly a lot of people would be genuinely unable to buy houses. But in a situation like this, would you even _want_ to buy a house any more? What if you took out a mortgage and then lost your job?

In my view, high house prices are here to stay for the forseeable future. The only thing that could realistically bring them down is if something _even worse_ happened in the economy - in which case buying houses wouldn't be very high on people's lists anyway.

No, the price of houses isn't the problem. Believe it or not, housing _is_ affordable. The question isn't 'Why are houses so expensive'? The question is 'Am I willing to buy what is actually within my budget'?
